//WHY DOES IT RECOGNIZE THIS AS "ENDOF"???
::

//it recognizes this is a proper expression, however accept does not work properly
int x = 0;

//it only recognizes this as a proper expression if there is a proper expression before it
(x == y)

use std::io;

//too much code causes a segfault???
//ONLY IN DEBUG MODE ASWELL
//probably an issue with debug symbols in cmake
